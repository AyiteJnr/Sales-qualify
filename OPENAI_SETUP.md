# AI Transcription Integration Setup

This document explains how to set up AI transcription for real-time call transcription using OpenRouter.

## Current Integration: OpenRouter

The system is now integrated with **OpenRouter** which provides access to OpenAI Whisper and other AI models with competitive pricing and better reliability.

**API Key Already Configured:** `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`

## Setup Steps (Optional - for custom keys)

### 1. Get OpenRouter API Key (Optional)

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

### 2. Configure Supabase Edge Function (Optional)

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Edge Functions
2. Navigate to `transcribe-audio` function
3. Set environment variable:
   - Key: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your OpenRouter API key (if using custom key)

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Record a call or upload an audio file
2. The system will automatically attempt to use OpenRouter Whisper
3. You'll see "ðŸŽ¯ AI Transcription Complete" for successful OpenRouter transcription
4. If OpenRouter fails, it falls back to mock transcription with "âš¡ Transcription Complete"

## Features

- **Real-time transcription**: Automatic transcription after recording stops
